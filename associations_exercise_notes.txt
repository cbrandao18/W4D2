example from lecture: user, chirps, and likes table
likes is the joins table that hold which user_id liked which chirp_id

in user.rb,
    has_many :liked_chirps
    through: likes
    source: :chirp

lines 7 and 8 will return a list of like objects, and then we are calling the chirp method on those to see a list of chirps that the user liked. this chirps method is in the likes model.
